Rater is a clone of Yelp that allows users to (R)ate and (R)eview restaurants they've (eat)en at and also a place for users to discover new restaurants they haven't been to before.

Feature Highlights

Rating and Reviewing
As a Rater, you can go onto business showpages and look for the restaurants you've been to and create, edit, delete your own reviews. The reviews will get posted up onto the business showpage and the ratings for the restaurant will change accordingly.

Search/Filter
To make things easier, the Rater app allows users to search the many restaurants listed on the website by name, categories, and location. The search bar is located on every page so that users can always switch to something a little more specific if they know exactly what they want. 

In addition, Rater has the functionality to let users filter all of the restaurants by price range to narrow down the results and to make things a tad cleaner.

Google Map API
Let's all agree that some of us are visual people and no app is complete without a Google Map that allows users to scroll around and look for businesses they want to visit by location. As of now, the app will always show every business that's listed on Rater, but we know that not everyone needs to look at all of them. Hang tight, we're in the process of creating a feature that will allow users to filter out search results based on where they are on the map. We ain't quite there yet, but it'll come!
